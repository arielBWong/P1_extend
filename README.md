## Instructions to run and test
paper1_refactor.py

## How to run paper1_refactor.py

experiment parameters are saved in p/zdt_problems_hvnd.json files

single_run() can be used to debug or demonstrate step by step processes

para_run() launches 29 seeds for each problem/setting across 48 processes

## How to generate plots
paper1_resconvert1.py
upzip paper1_results for experimental results 
(1) trainy_summary2csv is needed for creating intermediate data for plot

(2) hv_medianplot3in1 for creating Figure(c), variable 'prob_id' for specifying which problem to plot

(3) hvconverge_averageplot for creating Figure(d), variable 'problem_i' to specify which problem to plot


## Commit out plots for normal experiments
Method plot_process(ax, target_problem, train_y, norm_train_y, denormalize, True, krg, train_x)
needs to be set inactive ( i.e. set visual to false) for normal experiments.

There are multiple calls on it when visualization is needed.

step(0) get ready to plot
 
step (4-0) before enter propose infill x phase, conduct one krg search on ideal

step (4-1) DE search for proposing next x point

step (4-2) according to configuration determine whether to estimate new point

All visualization is set inactive by default, setting active might cause problems in normal experiments
